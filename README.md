# WilkinsHGuessIt-8-



Peer Review:Reed Godwin- WEll writtem and formated code. I really like the UI, it felt really proffessional. Something I found, was that when you Type "Y" to Repeat, some of the functions stopped working, it doesnt error out but some weird things happen. I would run it and mess with the "Play AGain" functions a few times, not sure the fix tho, probabluy something to do with loop. Otherwise its exemplaty work!
